## Intent Detection

Analyze what the user is trying to achieve:

### Primary Intents
- **code-generation**: Writing new code or functions
- **planning**: Designing architecture or breaking down tasks
- **refinement**: Improving existing code or prompts
- **debugging**: Finding and fixing issues
- **documentation**: Creating docs or explanations
- **prd-generation**: Creating requirements documents

### v4.0 Extended Intents
- **testing**: Writing tests, improving coverage
- **migration**: Version upgrades, porting code
- **security-review**: Security audits, vulnerability checks
- **learning**: Conceptual understanding, tutorials

### Intent Characteristics
Track these characteristics for each prompt:
- **hasCodeContext**: Does the prompt include code snippets?
- **hasTechnicalTerms**: Does it use specific technologies/frameworks?
- **isOpenEnded**: Is it exploratory vs. specific?
- **needsStructure**: Would structured output help?
